twitter_scraper was created by GitHub user bisguzar under the MIT License.
Original URL: https://github.com/bisguzar/twitter-scraper

The twitter_scraper here has been modified to:
- Also parse the Twitter user ID in profile.py
- Add an option to not include retweets
- Comment out the biography part of profile.py due to runtime bugs
(and it's not needed for this project)
